# Sunset-Hills
 
 This is another popular coding challenge that has been said to have been used in interviews for jobs that require an understanding of using JavaScript to perform a specific action.  If you are facing north looking at a row of buildings with varying heights, which buildings will be able to see the sunset?  If the building to the left is taller than a building to the right, then that means that building to the right can't see the sunset.
 
 First you fill in the boxes with what ever numbers you wish. These nubmers you have entered signify the height of a building.  Click the button provided, and the program will run to reveal which of those buildings would see the sunset.  The user can then enter new numbers in the fields and click the button again, and repeat this process as many times as they want.  Can be used as a tool to teach children to problem solve.
